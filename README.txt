RefScheduler is intended to aid game schedulers in the process of assigning games
to referees for any given league for any given sport in University of Waterloo
Campus Recreation.

Data storage will be involve text files and CSV files. Please refer to the system
specification (spec.pdf) and UML diagram for more information. I'm currently working
on an SRS document to well-define what I'm looking to create before delving too deep
into the details and implementation of this project.

Contact information for the developer is harris.rasheed@uwaterloo.ca.
